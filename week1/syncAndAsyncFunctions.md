**Synchronous Functions:**
Happening Sequentially
Makes it all slow

**Asynchorous Functions:**
Things are happening parallely - context swicthing is happening between tasks - or delegate tasks to different processor
makes the things faster
Examples:
inbuilt function setTimeout() of js is asynchronous
fs.readFile() -to read file from filesystem
fetch() - to fetch data from an API endpoint
